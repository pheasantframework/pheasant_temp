///
/// Every [PheasantTemplate] class instance has two main parts:
///
/// 1. The `template` field, which represents the pheasant template string that is to be rendered.
/// The [template] variable is of type [String] and is automatically overrided for every instance of this class from the `renderFunc` function
///
/// 2. The `render` function, which returns the rendered html element to be injected into the DOM.
/// The [render] function takes in one required parameter, the [template], and one optional parameter, [state].
/// There is no base definition of this function, as the definition of the function is generated by the `renderFunc` function.
///
/// Any other variables or functions defined in the `<script>` part of the `.phs` file, is added as normal fields and methods repsectively to the class.
///
/// Here is an instance of this class definition:

/// ```

///   @override
///   String? template = """
/// <div>
///   <p>Hello World</p>
/// </div>
/// """
